- What made it easier for you to implement the view?
I guess that the option of dragging elements to the interface/xml. Also, I reused the code that you implemented on the AdapterList to load the other information that you asked for in the ActivityInfo. It was a bit hard to understand, but when I did, it was easier to adapt it.

- What made it difficult for you to implement the view?

At the beggining, it was quite difficult to do so. It was still very abstract to me on how this works. I had to view some udemy videos and read several times the previous code on how to change from one activity to another, etc. I guess learning a new language is always challenging. Also, I thought that the xml files were all about typing out its elements, but then I figured out the way in which you can select the items and drag them to the interface.
